        entire Sept 2, 2019 issue</a> to the periodic table (it&rsquo;s 150 years
        old this year) and the elements it contains. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-08-28/the-modern-triumph-of-the-periodic-table-of-elements\">From
        the introductory essay</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Over the past century and
        a half, but particularly since World War II, scientists and engineers have
        learned to treat the periodic table like a banquet table-a bountiful spread
        from which to pluck what they need. There&rsquo;s scandium in bicycle frames,
        tin (stannous fluoride) in toothpaste, tungsten in catheters, and arsenic
        in some computer chips. We are well past the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and
        the Iron Age, and into the Everything Age, because almost every entry on the
        periodic table is being put to some kind of use in today&rsquo;s economy (excluding
        synthetic elements that are costly to make and highly radioactive, such as
        einsteinium).</p>\n\n<p>Cellphones exemplify the complexification. The first
        ones in the 1980s &ldquo;were the size of a shoebox and consisted of 25 to
        30 elements,&rdquo; Larry Meinert, U.S. Geological Survey deputy associate
        director for energy and minerals, said in 2017. &ldquo;Today, they fit in
        your pocket or on your wrist and are made from about 75 different elements,
        almost three-quarters of the periodic table.&rdquo; That may include tantalum
        from Rwanda, potassium from Belarus, silver from Mexico, tin from Myanmar,
        carbon from India, and germanium from China.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Scrolling
        down <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2019-periodic-table-elements-issue/\">on
        the main story page</a> will take you on a modern-day tour of the periodic
        table from the lightest elements (hydrogen, helium, lithium) to the heavier
        ones (uranium, polonium) to some fake ones (adamantium, unobtanium, feminum).</p>\n\n\n<div

        in <a href=\"https://kottke.org/19/08/my-2019-roadtrip-along-the-pacific-coast-of-the-us\">a
        post about my west coast roadtrip</a>, one of the things I heard about during
        my visit to Pixar was their AI spiders. For Toy Story 4, the production team
        wanted to add some dusty ambiance to the antique store in the form of cobwebs.</p>\n\n<p><img
        src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=\"
        width=\"1000\" height=\"419\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Toy Story Cobwebs\" data-src=\"/plus/misc/images/toy-story-cobwebs.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p>Rather
        than having to painstakingly create the webs by hand as they&rsquo;d done
        in the past, technical director Hosuk Chang <a href=\"https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/toy-story-4-second-chance-antiques-store-design.html\">created
        a swarm of AI spiders</a> that could weave the webs just like a real spider
        would.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>We actually saw the AI spiders in action and
        it was jaw-dropping to see something so simple, yet so technically amazing
        to create realistic backgrounds elements like cobwebs. The spiders appeared
        as red dots that would weave their way between two wood elements just like
        a real spider would.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>All the animators had to do is
        <a href=\"https://www.thewaltdisneycompany.com/setting-the-scene-how-technology-created-a-richer-playset-in-toy-story-4/\">tell
        the spiders where the cobwebs needed to be</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He
        guided the spiders to where he wanted them to build cobwebs, and they&rsquo;d
        do the job for us. And when you see those cobwebs overlaid on the rest of
        the scene, it gives the audience the sense that this place has been here for
        a while.&rdquo; Without that program, animators would have had to make the
        webs one strand at a time, which would have taken several months. &ldquo;You
        have to tell the spider where the connection points of the cobweb should go,&rdquo;
        Jordan says, &ldquo;but then it does the rest.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Chang
        and his colleague David Luoh <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3328183&amp;preflayout=flat\">presented

        compiled a list of nine activities and rights denied to women in America in
        1971</a>, just 48 years ago. The list includes:</p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/forty-years-ago-women-had-a-hard-time-getting-credit-cards-180949289/\">A
        woman couldn&rsquo;t get a credit card in her own name</a>. They often needed
        a man to co-sign for a card. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Credit_Opportunity_Act\">The
        Equal Credit Opportunity Act</a> put a stop to this discrimination in 1974.</li>\n\n<p></p><li>Until
        the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_Discrimination_Act\">Pregnancy
        Discrimination Act</a> of 1978, women could be fired for getting pregnant
        (or not hired if they were pregnant). Despite the act, pregnancy discrimination
        <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/21/business/pregnancy-discrimination-miscarriages.html\">continues
        today</a>.</li>\n\n<p></p><li>Women couldn&rsquo;t attend certain Ivy League
        schools. Harvard did not fully admit women into its undergraduate program
        <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/04/hard-earned-gains-for-women-at-harvard/\">until
        1977</a>, Dartmouth took <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeducation_at_Dartmouth\">until
        1972</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/archive/jul_aug09/features1\">Columbia
        waited until 1983</a>.</li>\n\n<p></p><li>In some states, women couldn&rsquo;t
        say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to sex with their husbands. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape_in_the_United_States#To_1993\">In
        1993</a>, the last two states (Oklahoma and North Carolina) withdrew their
        marital rape exemptions. But even today, several states treat marital rape
        as a lesser offense with smaller penalties compared to non-marital rape.</li>\n\n<p></p><li><a
        href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenstadt_v._Baird\">Until a 1972 Supreme
        Court case</a>, unmarried women in some states were prohibited from purchasing
        birth control pills.</li></ul><p>Ms magazine published <a href=\"https://msmagazine.com/2013/05/28/10-things-that-american-women-could-not-do-before-the-1970s/\">a
        similar list</a> back in 2013 that also included the difficulty in getting
        a divorce without cause and obtain a safe &amp; legal abortion in all 50 states.
        <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/136295-what-was-it-like-for-women-not-to-be-allowed-their-own-credit-cards-10-women\">Bustle
        talked to several women</a> about what discrimination was like before many
        of these changes took place.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I was denied a job in 1970
        because I was newly pregnant. They actually had a question on the application
        regarding the date of your last menstrual period. Also, with my second child
        in 1974, they were not required to hold your position while you were on maternity
        leave, and I was told that my job was no longer open and I had to file for
        unemployment.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>As a reminder, women only gained the
        right to vote in America fewer than 100 years ago.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"entry-tags-title\">More

        25 Most Important Characters of the Past 25 Years</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>We
        polled critics and other culture obsessives from Slate and beyond to assemble
        an enormous master list of influential characters. They were animated and
        live-action, wizard and Muggle, human and avian, fictional and based on actual
        persons, living and dead. They came from movies, books, TV series, video games,
        tweets, podcasts, comics, songs, and (in a surprise to us) more than one musical.
        Reflecting our franchise-driven time, many of them came from many of those
        media at once. The only rule was that they must have originated in a work
        of culture sometime in the past quarter-century, which meant no Simpsons or
        hobbits or diner-dwelling New Yorkers who argue about nothing. Then we ruthlessly
        winnowed down the list to the most crucial of those characters, the ones who
        have left an outsize mark on our planet circa 2019, to assemble this new pantheon.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><img

        class=\"post\">\n\n<p>Twenty-five years ago, physicist Cesare Marchetti <a
        href=\"http://www.cesaremarchetti.org/archive/electronic/basic_instincts.pdf\">argued</a>
        that people, on average, tend to keep their commutes to about an hour a day,
        round-trip. For Citylab, Jonathan English looks at how this inclination has
        interacted with advances in transportation to affect <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/08/commute-time-city-size-transportation-urban-planning-history/597055/\">how
        cities grow and evolve</a>. For instance, walking and travel by horse kept
        cities to an effective diameter of a few miles, allowing their density to
        grow over many centuries.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Sure enough, most cities from
        the ancients to the Industrial Revolution did not grow much bigger than a
        two-mile diameter. Their core areas were often even smaller, though some of
        the poor lived in settlements outside the city gates. Ancient Rome packed
        as many as a million people into an area a little more than two miles in diameter.
        Medieval Paris stretched about two miles from the Bastille to the Louvre,
        Vienna&rsquo;s Innere Stadt measures only one mile in diameter, and the historic
        City of London is nicknamed the &ldquo;Square Mile&rdquo; for a reason. Beijing&rsquo;s
        walls enclosed an inner city about three miles in diameter; into the 20th
        century, that still made up most of the developed area.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Rail,
        streetcars, bicycles, subways, and cars followed, each increasing the amount
        of distance from a city&rsquo;s center that could be reached within Marchetti&rsquo;s
        time limit.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The car on the expressway enabled large
        numbers of people to travel long distances on a day-to-day basis. Instead
        of small railroad suburbs, where housing was restricted to a short radius
        around stations, drivers spread out across suburbs could now commute 20 miles
        in 30 minutes. If the streetcar city covered 50 square miles, the 40-mile-diameter
        expressway city could cover over 1,250 square miles.*</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<div

        class=\"post\">\n\n\n\n<p>Guernica is one of Pablo Picasso&rsquo;s greatest
        masterpieces, and, like a lot of his other work, can be difficult to decipher.
        The painting is obviously anti-war, anti-fascist, and pro-Spain, but beyond
        that, art scholars have been puzzling over details for decades. In this TED-Ed
        video, Iseult Gillespie offers a short tour of the painting and its history.
        You might find <a href=\"https://the-artifice.com/picasso-guernica/\">this
        piece</a> (and the list of works cited at the bottom) useful as well.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>However,
        Picasso declared the inspiration for the painting was the aftermath of the
        1937 attack of the Spanish town Guernica. On market day April 26, 1937, the
        citizens of Guernica gathered for their customary shopping and socializing;
        unfortunately, German war planes descended upon the town. The Nazis bombed
        Guernica and killed 1600 people; fires burned for three days and destroyed
        the town. Picasso captured the &ldquo;la douleur et la mort&rdquo; or &ldquo;pain
        and death&rdquo; of the aftermath. Yet, Picasso maintained his place that
        he did not assign meaning to the individual images. Nonetheless, this large-scale
        monochromatic painting encourages the inner critic to react, deconstruct,
        and create their own dialogue.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/05/12/a-different-guernica/\">This
        account of the bombing</a> shows how bloodthirsty and ruthless the Nazis were
        in 1937.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Besides celebrating the F&uuml;hrer&rsquo;s
        birthday, the attack on Guernica served as a tactical military and aeronautical
        experiment to test the Luftwaffe&rsquo;s ability to annihilate an entire city
        and crush the morale of its people. The Condor Legion&rsquo;s chief of staff,
        Colonel Wolfram von Richthofen, painstakingly devised the operation to maximize
        human casualties, and above all deaths. A brief initial bombing at 4:30 PM
        drove much of the population into air-raid shelters. When Guernica&rsquo;s
        citizens emerged from these shelters to rescue the wounded, a second, longer
        wave of bombing began, trapping them in the town center from which there was
        no escape. Low-flying planes strafed the streets with machine-gun fire. Those
        who had managed to survive were incinerated by the flames or asphyxiated by
        the lack of oxygen. Three hours of coordinated air strikes leveled the city
        and killed over 1,500 civilians. In his war diary, Richthofen described the
        operation as &ldquo;absolutely fabulous!&hellip;a complete technical success.&rdquo;
        The F&uuml;hrer was so thrilled that, two years later, he ordered Richthofen
        to employ the same bombing techniques, on an infinitely greater scale, to
        lay waste to Warsaw, thereby setting off World War II.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>With
        that sort of casual brutality, it&rsquo;s no wonder Picasso was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/26/pablo-picasso-guernica-spain-war\">still
        livid about it</a> years later:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>In occupied Paris, a
        Gestapo officer who had barged his way into Picasso&rsquo;s apartment pointed
        at a photo of the mural, Guernica, asking: &ldquo;Did you do that?&rdquo;
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Picasso replied, &ldquo;you did&rdquo;, his wit fizzing
        with the anger that animates the piece.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>(via <a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2019/09/what-makes-guernica-so-shocking.html\">open

        but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless

        I died?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yup. But don&rsquo;t feel bad about it. Everyone
        dies,&rdquo; I said.</p>\n\n<p>You looked around. There was nothingness. Just
        you and me. &ldquo;What is this place?&rdquo; You asked. &ldquo;Is this the
        afterlife?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;More or less,&rdquo; I said.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<div

        an object down to Earth from the International Space Station is easy: you
        can just toss it out the door and wait. Eventually, it will fall to Earth.</p>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s
        a very small amount of atmosphere at the ISS&rsquo;s altitude. It&rsquo;s
        not much, but it&rsquo;s enough to produce a tiny but measurable amount of
        drag. This drag sooner or later causes objects to slow down, fall into a lower
        and lower orbit, and eventually hit the atmosphere and (usually) burn up.
        The ISS also feels this drag; it uses thrusters to compensate, periodically
        boosting itself up into a higher orbit to make up for lost altitude. If it
        didn&rsquo;t, its orbit would gradually decay until it fell back to Earth.</p>\n\n<p>This
        shipping method has two big problems: First, your package will burn up in
        the atmosphere before it ever reaches the ground. And second, if it does survive,
        you&rsquo;ll have no way to know where it will land. To deliver your package,
        you&rsquo;ll have to solve both these problems.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Fun
        fact: a piece of paper drifting down from orbit might move slowly enough not
        to burn up on reentry.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"entry-tags-title\">More about...</div>\n<ul

        Conditioning is Warming the Earth</a></h2>\n\n<div class=\"meta\">\n<div class=\"author\"><span

        class=\"post\">\n\n<p>Modern society has an air conditioning problem. One
        of the most popular responses by the world&rsquo;s population to global warming
        is to use air conditioning. Air conditioning is very greenhouse gas-intensive,
        which contributes to the warming of the planet. Which causes more people use
        air conditioning. And so on. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/29/the-air-conditioning-trap-how-cold-air-is-heating-the-world\">In
        a long Guardian piece</a>, Stephen Buranyi lays out how air conditioning came
        to be so ubiquitous and how we might escape this air conditioning trap we
        find ourselves in.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>There are just over 1bn single-room
        air conditioning units in the world right now - about one for every seven
        people on earth. Numerous reports have projected that by 2050 there are likely
        to be more than 4.5bn, making them as ubiquitous as the mobile phone is today.
        The US already uses as much electricity for air conditioning each year as
        the UK uses in total. The IEA projects that as the rest of the world reaches
        similar levels, air conditioning will use about 13% of all electricity worldwide,
        and produce 2bn tonnes of CO2 a year - about the same amount as India, the
        world&rsquo;s third-largest emitter, produces today.</p>\n\n<p>All of these
        reports note the awful irony of this feedback loop: warmer temperatures lead
        to more air conditioning; more air conditioning leads to warmer temperatures.
        The problem posed by air conditioning resembles, in miniature, the problem
        we face in tackling the climate crisis. The solutions that we reach for most
        easily only bind us closer to the original problem.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Weirdly,
        the article doesn&rsquo;t mention that most air conditioning units contain
        chemical refrigerants (CFCs and HCFCs) that, if released, <a href=\"https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/materials/refrigerant-management\">&ldquo;have
        1,000 to 9,000 times greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide&rdquo;</a>.
        Phasing out the use of CFCs &amp; HCFCs in new units and capturing the refrigerants
        in discarded units can prevent global warming to such a degree that it&rsquo;s
        <a href=\"https://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank\">the #1 way
        to mitigate the effects of climate change</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"entry-tags-title\">More

        Nejapa in El Salvador have been commemorating a volcanic eruption in 1658
        which destroyed the town, by hurling fireballs at each other.</p>\n\n<p>The
        annual event has been a tradition since 1922 and the fireballs are said to

        class=\"post\">\n\n<p>Waffle House is prepared to make you breakfast at all
        hours of the day in any kind of weather. The restaurant chain is so widely
        respected for its severe weather preparedness that a former director of FEMA
        <a href=\"https://www.ehstoday.com/fire_emergencyresponse/disaster-planning/waffles-risk-management-0706\">started
        using their stores</a> as an indicator of how bad a particular storm or disaster
        was:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The &ldquo;Waffle House Index,&rdquo; first coined
        by Federal Emergency Management Agency Director W. Craig Fugate, is based
        on the extent of operations and service at the restaurant following a storm
        and indicates how prepared a business is in case of a natural disaster.</p>\n\n<p>For
        example, if a Waffle House store is open and offering a full menu, the index
        is green. If it is open but serving from a limited menu, it&rsquo;s yellow.
        When the location has been forced to close, the index is red. Because Waffle
        House is well prepared for disasters, Kouvelis said, it&rsquo;s rare for the
        index to hit red. For example, the Joplin, Mo., Waffle House survived the
        tornado and remained open.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Annie Blanks <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/01/hurricane-dorian-waffle-house-index-disasters/2187708001/\">recently
        visited the &ldquo;Waffle House Storm Center&rdquo;</a> in advance of Hurricane
        Dorian&rsquo;s predicted landfall in Florida.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>When any
        of the stores are in danger of being hit by severe weather, so-called &ldquo;jump
        teams&rdquo; are activated to be ready to deploy wherever needed. </p>\n\n<p>Jump
        teams are made up of Waffle House contractors, construction workers, gas line
        experts, restaurant operators, food providers and other associates who are
        assembled and ready to go wherever needed at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Their
        purpose is to help relieve local Waffle House operators and employees who
        need to evacuate, be with their families or tend to their homes when a storm
        hits, and help make sure restaurants are able to open quickly after a storm
        or stay open during a storm.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnniePNJ/status/1168582629467312129\">On
        Twitter</a>, Blanks shared a photo of the four different pared-down menus
        that Waffle House prepares for disasters.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=\"
