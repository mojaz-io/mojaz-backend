        (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20897368\">Hacker News</a>):</p>\n<blockquote
        cite=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/a-message-about-ios-security/\">\n<p>Last
        week, Google published a blog about vulnerabilities that Apple fixed for iOS
        users in February.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;A blog,&rdquo; rather than
        &ldquo;a blog post&rdquo;? I love how Apple is subtly trying to discredit
        Project Zero by implying that it&rsquo;s a mere blog. And let&rsquo;s be sure
        everyone knows it&rsquo;s affiliated with Google, the privacy bad guys, even
        though it&rsquo;s a responsible, technically focused group. Of course, the
        quote you&rsquo;re reading is not from a blog by Apple PR. It&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Apple
        Statement.&rdquo; From the Newsroom. Which has an <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/rss-feed.rss\">RSS
        feed</a>, like blogs do. (Though the feed isn&rsquo;t discoverable from the
        statement page.)</p>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/a-message-about-ios-security/\">\n<p>First,
        the sophisticated attack was narrowly focused, not a broad-based exploit of
        iPhones &ldquo;en masse&rdquo; as described.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/a-very-deep-dive-into-ios-exploit.html\">Project
        Zero</a> literally referred to &ldquo;a small collection of hacked websites&rdquo;
        that received &ldquo;receive thousands of visitors per week.&rdquo; And it
        does seem like a particular subpopulation was targeted &ldquo;en masse.&rdquo;
        The sites in question were on the public Internet; it wasn&rsquo;t links being
        sent to target particular individuals. Apple is blaming the messenger for
        things it didn&rsquo;t even say.</p>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/a-message-about-ios-security/\">\n<p>The
        attack affected fewer than a dozen websites that focus on content related
        to the Uighur community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh, I get it. Most people
        would consider &ldquo;fewer than a dozen&rdquo; to be &ldquo;a small collection.&rdquo;
        But in Apple-speak, there were &ldquo;a small number&rdquo; of <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2012/07/05/corrupt-app-store-binaries-crashing-on-launch/\">corrupt
        App Store binaries causing crashes</a>, and &ldquo;a small number&rdquo; of
        <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2018/10/16/the-2018-macbook-keyboards-have-the-same-old-problems/#the-2018-macbook-keyboards-have-the-same-old-problems-2019-03-27\">MacBook
        Pro users experiencing butterfly keyboard problems</a>, not to be confused
        with the &ldquo;very small number&rdquo; of iPhones that <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/iphone6s-unexpectedshutdown\">unexpectedly</a>
        <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/12/06/apples-support-gap/\">shut down</a>.
        So, yeah, I can see why Apple wants people to know that this &ldquo;small
        collection&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;millions.&rdquo; Although there
        are apparently <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Uighur\">10 million</a>
        Uigurs in China&#8230;</p>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/a-message-about-ios-security/\">\n<p>Google&rsquo;s
        post, issued six months after iOS patches were released[&#8230;]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s
        great that Project Zero reported this in a responsible way, because now we
        can downplay it as old news.</p>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/a-message-about-ios-security/\">\n<p>Second,
        all evidence indicates that these website attacks were only operational for
        a brief period, roughly two months, not &ldquo;two years&rdquo; as Google
        implies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how they know that there
        weren&rsquo;t other sites than the ones they considered. Why would someone
        go to the trouble of targeting iOS 10.0.1 separately from iOS 10.3&mdash;or
        even target iOS 10 at all&mdash;if the attack was only for two months in 2018
        (after iOS 12 was out)?</p>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/a-message-about-ios-security/\">\n<p>We
        fixed the vulnerabilities in question in February &mdash; working extremely
        quickly to resolve the issue just 10 days after we learned about it. When
        Google approached us, we were already in the process of fixing the exploited
        bugs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Apparently, this is because they were tipped
        off by the FBI first, but mentioning that would make this seems more serious
        than Apple wants. This way they get to pretend that they&rsquo;re smarter
        than Google.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, an odd response from Apple. Maybe this is
        really smart PR before the big event next week. But, from my perspective,
        it is not a good look.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lorenzofb/status/1170025885904359424\">Lorenzo

        I&rsquo;m still fascinated by the &ldquo;fewer than a dozen&rdquo; phrasing.
        Surely, Apple would want us to know if it were fewer than ten, i.e. single
        digits. So the number is likely ten or eleven, yet they didn&rsquo;t want
        to say the exact number. And I don&rsquo;t think the number of sites is actually
        that important. A single popular site would be worse than many small ones.
        The number that matters is how many people were affected, and it&rsquo;s likely
        not small. Yet this is the lead &ldquo;fact&rdquo; that Apple wanted to communicate.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s
        also worth noting that this response dropped on a Friday, and that it doesn&rsquo;t
        include a link to the post it&rsquo;s critiquing, or mention its title or
        author. So if you don&rsquo;t actually read it for yourself, you&rsquo;re
        left with the implication that it was some sort of dishonest corporate smear
        campaign.</p>\n\n<p>See also: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/06/apple-addresses-ios-vulnerabilities/\">MacRumors</a>,

        why did Apple respond to that Project Zero disclosure anyway? The researchers

        think it&rsquo;s because some of the reporting sensationalized Project Zero&rsquo;s
        work and didn&rsquo;t make it clear that the patches were already in place.
        Apple chose to attack Google, rather than the media responsible for that coverage.</p>\n<p>That
        might also have been avoided if Apple had kept its own customers informed
        about its products, instead of leaving its competitor to disclose the biggest
        security incident in iOS history. Now, every time Apple touts how secure its
        stuff is, you have to wonder whether there are more incidents like this that
        they are hiding from you, which is a shame because I think they&rsquo;re doing
        a pretty good job with the actual security work.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1170064458003054594\">Alex

        for help.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Zipcars in general work just fine when
        they do not have cell service, he said, as they have some internal memory
        that lets them function even when out of touch with the company servers. Indeed,
        making sure that the cars work when out of reception is a &ldquo;mission-critical
        success factor&rdquo; for the company, he said. Still, cars without reception
        become vulnerable in a few scenarios: when members lose or do not have their
        physical Zipcard with them, when they exceed their reservation time or want
        to extend their Zipcar reservation, or when the vehicle battery dies. That
        last scenario was the one my family and I found ourselves in, though we did
        not know it at the time.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>He was amazed&mdash;and
        I was amazed&mdash;in part because Zipcar does not warn users that they need
        to take extra precautions in areas without reception, whether the bowels of
        parking garages or overlook points on mountainous roads.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I
        wonder if the car battery died because it was continually searching for a
        faint cell signal.</p><p class=\"tags\"><a rel=\"tag\" href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/tag/batterylife/\">Battery

        The longer I use Face ID, the more I&rsquo;m annoyed at how much slower it

        major series of attacks against iOS</a> using sophisticated, zero-day exploits

        would be infected with implanted malware without having to interact with the
        user in any way. That malware could monitor the infected device&rsquo;s GPS

        reported all the exploits to Apple quickly, and Apple responded by patching
        them all in iOS within days, you&rsquo;re protected from these particular
        attacks as long as you&rsquo;re running an updated version of iOS. The implant

        and provide information to Apple, but it felt like we were tossing bug reports

        recently released a menu bar Mac app called <a href=\"https://www.hexedbits.com/redeye/\">Red
        Eye</a>. It&rsquo;s free and you can <a href=\"https://www.hexedbits.com/redeye/\">download
        it here</a>. It prevents your Mac from going to sleep.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Unfortunately,
        Red Eye was rejected from the Mac App Store. I wanted to distribute there,
        as well as independently. The first reason was a <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/themes/\">Human
        Interface Guidelines</a> violation, because you have to right-click Red Eye
        in the menu bar to open the menu to quit the app, which reviewers said is
        &ldquo;confusing to users&rdquo;. I think that&rsquo;s debatable. The second
        reason for rejection was for &ldquo;duplicate functionality that already exists
        in the Mac App Store&rdquo;, which I think is bullshit and arbitrary. I counted
        three dozen Markdown editors in the Mac App Store before I got tired of scrolling
        through the search results. It is especially frustrating when the Mac App

        Timeular device</a>. It&rsquo;s a polygon-shaped piece of plastic and electronics
        that connects to my iPhone. I can assign a different task to each side, and
        when I switch modes, say going from screencasting to legal clients, I just
        flip the gizmo to put the briefcase icon (legal) sunny side up, and the iPhone
        app starts tracking time toward the new task.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I love
        how this is a physical device that&rsquo;s always available in front of you.
        No need to switch apps on your iPhone or find the right window on your Mac.
        With that being said, I do sometimes like seeing a running counter and often
        work with my iPhone in a Qi dock, displaying <a href=\"https://www.hourstimetracking.com/\">Hours</a>.</p>\n\n<p>With
        the current summer sale, Timeular costs $53 for the hardware and basic features,
        $9/month for advanced features, or $299 for &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; tracking
        with no subscription. You need the subscription or lifetime package in order
        to be able to export your data&mdash;not cool.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://timeular.com/pricing/\">potential
        downside</a>:</p>\n<blockquote cite=\"https://timeular.com/pricing/\">\n<p>Can
        I use the Tracker without internet connection?</p>\n<p>No, in order to enable

        (laptop or smartphone) must be connected to the internet. You do not need
        a wifi connection, a cellular connection works as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I
        don&rsquo;t want to send my time tracking data to the cloud, and I especially
        don&rsquo;t want to spend cellular data to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Previously:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a

        cite=\"https://fetchsoftworks.com/fetch/news/thirty-years-of-fetch\">\n<p>Of
        the thousands of other Mac apps on the market on September 1, 1989 I can only
        think of four (Panorama, Word, Excel and Photoshop) that are still sold today.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>I
        imagined a new Fetch that had all the improvements that I&rsquo;d daydreamed
        about, and none of the old code that made it so hard to implement new features.</p>\n<p>This,
        of course, is one of the classic blunders in software development. It was
        exhilarating to be free of the shackles of our legacy code. But with a blank
        slate and no clear destination or deadline, we spent years without getting
        anywhere close to having a product that we could actually sell. Meanwhile
        Fetch 5 stagnated, and customers who needed more than Fetch 5 could offer
        moved on.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>In January, 2018 I finally accepted that
        I wasn&rsquo;t going to make Fetch 6 happen. Apple had made it clear that
        32-bit apps like Fetch 5.7 weren&rsquo;t long for this world, so it looked
        like the time had come to lay Fetch to rest for good. But I wasn&rsquo;t quite
        ready to say goodbye, and it occurred to me that there was a third option,
        something between finishing Fetch 6 and letting Fetch die: I could port Fetch
        5.7&rsquo;s Carbon user interface to Cocoa and make a 64-bit Fetch 5.8.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Previously:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a

        Development</a>:</p>\n<blockquote cite=\"https://blog.obdev.at/what-we-have-learned-from-a-vulnerability/\">\n<p>It
        all began with a security improvement by Apple in macOS High Sierra (10.13).
        Apple had revoked access to the folder <code>/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports</code>
        for non-admin users. The protection goes so far that even a root process spawned
        by <code>AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges()</code> cannot access the folder.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Every
        installer application which needs root permissions is now urged to install
        a system-wide daemon for this purpose. This system-wide daemon is usually
        left behind, because Apple provides no API for removing it.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>In
        an internal code review, another developer looked over the code and verified
        all assumptions. He did not find a proof for the assumption that XPC connections
        are authorized by the system. Since there was little information available,
        he made a test project and could exploit our privileged helper tool!</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>The
        helper (and the app using the helper) should check the identity of the peer
        before performing any operations. Even if an <code>AuthorizationExternalForm</code>
        is already used. The most secure way for such a check is the code signature.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Note
        that this example uses the private <code>NSXPCConnection.auditToken</code>
        property. If we want to avoid using a private property, we need to use the
        Unix process ID. But this is inherently insecure (see <a href=\"https://saelo.github.io/presentations/warcon18_dont_trust_the_pid.pdf\">Don&rsquo;t
        trust the PID!</a> by Samuel Gro&szlig;). We therefore decided to use <code>auditToken</code>
        anyway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, because Apple decided to protect the logs
        folder, and the documentation is not very good, the Little Snitch developers
        ended up introducing a privilege escalation vulnerability, and even now they
        can&rsquo;t make it fully secure without using private API. These are smart
        developers with a long history building a highly regarded security-focused
        product. Of course it sounds like a good idea to make the logs secure, but
        I think we can ask whether it was worth the cost in collateral security and
        engineering time. And why should it be so difficult and error-prone for an
        app to facilitate the customer sending in a diagnostic report?</p>\n\n<p>See

        a LaunchAgent, which I&rsquo;d guess is closer to what you&rsquo;d really

        this example, the ellipsis button is akin to choosing File &gt; Get Info on
        the Mac to open the Get Info window, which displays metadata about the selected
        file. Interestingly, Wallet only recently switched to using the ellipsis button;
        before that, it relied on a button that looked like the lowercase letter i.
        Perhaps the i was awkward when localizing the interface into other languages
        and script systems, but it is <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:grs:7001:PI_PF_001\">an
        ISO standard symbol</a>.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say you then switch to the Music
        app to play some tunes. While playing a song, you see yet another ellipsis
        button. You might assume that tapping it would display more information about
        the song, perhaps like what you can see in iTunes when you choose Edit &gt;
        Song Info. But no, the ellipsis button in the iOS Music app brings up a list
        of track-specific actions, like adding it to your library, adding it to a
        playlist, creating an Apple Music station based on it, and so on.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>These
        interface confusions extend to the Files app in iOS 13 as well. Much like
        with Wallet, Apple replaced a perfectly understandable Edit link with an ellipsis
        button. [&#8230;] No, this time it offers commands for scanning documents,
        connecting to servers, and the options to edit locations, favorites, and tags.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Reminds
        me of how the Mac gear icon has been used for so many different purposes.</p><p

        Authorized Service Providers (AASPs).</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>There is no
        cost to join Apple&rsquo;s independent repair program. To qualify for the

        is also selling a limited number of parts. These include iPhone batteries,

        independent repair professionals to do a wide variety of repairs (for example,
        as of October 2018, it wasn&rsquo;t selling charging ports for iPhones, a

        or that it actually aligns with this. The privacy effort is focussed on user
        consent. Once consent is given the data should be readily available. This
        allows for application integration, automation, platform extension and avoids
        duplicated effort. To me it seems we are actually looking at an incomplete
        implementation. API to search Core Spotlight is missing. API to access mail
        messages is missing.</p><p>For example: once access to photos is granted,
        photos can be accessed via the file system, via scripting, via <code>PHPhotoLibrary</code>,
        and via <code>MLMediaLibrary</code> frameworks. All sorts of things become
        (resp. remain) possible. All hinges on user consent.</p><p>The current siloing
        and move to Core Spotlight has two problems:</p><ul><li>Much information is
        no longer available as siloing proceeds faster than API evolution. E.g. there
        is no API to access not notes or email messages. This limits integration and
        automation opportunities. In some cases, third-party developers can resort
        to duplicating effort. E.g. by direct access to IMAP servers</li><li>Where
        public API to silos exist (PHPhotoLibrary, Contacts, &#8230;) the API lack
        the unifying nature of Spotlight / <code>NSMetadataQuery</code>. A public
        API to Core Spotlight should solve that.</li></ul></blockquote><p class=\"tags\"><a

        this doesn&rsquo;t help with getting intermediate releases. You should be

        unusual error messages that can occur during the attempted installation of

        or a more vague <em>&ldquo;An error occurred while preparing the installation.
        Try running again&rdquo;</em> error message.  Sometimes these can be resolved
        by simply rebooting and trying to reinstall OS X again (or re-downloading
        the OS X installer if it was damaged), but if the error messages are persistent,
        then you may find that modifying the system date of the Mac can be the resolution.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It
        seems that the installer is signed with a certificate that has expired. When
        booted from the installer, you can open Terminal and use the <code>date</code>
        command to <a href=\"https://bensmann.no/changing-system-date-from-terminal-os-x-recovery\">set

        was kept small and focused in order to be incorporated quickly. So, if you
        were to ask, <em>&ldquo;What do you actually get by conforming to <code>Identifiable</code>?&rdquo;</em>,
        the answer right now is <em>&ldquo;Not much.&rdquo;</em> As mentioned in the
        <a href=\"https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0261-identifiable.md#future-directions\">future
        directions</a>, conformance to <code>Identifiable</code> has the potential
        to unlock simpler and/or more optimized versions of other functionality, such
        as the new <a href=\"https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0240-ordered-collection-diffing.md\">ordered
        collection diffing</a> APIs.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>Normalization is the key
        to successfully using strings as identifiers. The easiest place to do this
        is in the initializer, but, again, if you find yourself repeating this code
        over and over, <a href=\"https://nshipster.com/propertywrapper/\">property
        wrappers</a> can help you here, too. [&#8230;] Unfortunately, the Foundation
        framework doesn&rsquo;t provide a single, suitable API for URL canonicalization,
        but <code>URL</code> and <code>URLComponents</code> provide enough on their
        own to let you roll your own[&#8230;]</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>As we&rsquo;ve
        said <a href=\"https://nshipster.com/numericcast/\">time</a> and <a href=\"https://nshipster.com/never/\">again</a>,
        often it&rsquo;s the smallest additions to the language and standard library
        that have the biggest impact on how we write code. (This speaks to the thoughtful,
        <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408/\">protocol-oriented</a>
        design of Swift&rsquo;s standard library.)</p><p>Because what <code>Identifiable</code>
        does is kind of amazing: it extends reference semantics to value types.</p></blockquote><p

        makes it take longer to find out about and adapt to these types of changes.

        collection of tools that allow signing and encrypting of data using asymmetric
        cryptography (with public / private keys). Git uses GPG to sign and verify
        commits and tags. With such a signature, you can easily verify that a commit
        (or tag) was <em>really</em> made by a specific user.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Tower
        indicates directly in its History views if a commit was signed or not. On
        top of that, you can also see the signature status (green / orange / red)
        and access additional information through a popover window.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Apart
        from commits, you can also verify the signatures for tags in Tower. Either

        href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1858\">CVE-2019-8646</a>
        is a somewhat unusual vulnerability I reported in iMessage. It has a number
        of consequences, including information leakage and the ability to remotely
        read files on a device. This blog post discusses the ways that an attacker
        could use this bug. It is a good example of how the large number of classes
        available for <code>NSKeyedArchiver</code> deserialization can make a bug
        more versatile. It&rsquo;s also a good example of how minor functional bugs
        can make a vulnerability more useful.</p><p>Please note that this blog post
        assumes some familiarity with <code>NSKeyedArchiver</code> deserialization.
        If you haven&rsquo;t read our general <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-fully-remote-attack-surface-of.html\">post</a>
        on iMessage, I&rsquo;d recommend reading that first.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>There
        are two immediate problems with being able to deserialize this class in an
        untrusted context. One is that it has the potential to allow a process to
        access a file that it is not authorized to access, because the process doing
        the deserialization is the one that loads the file. When I reported this bug,
        I thought that this was more likely to be a concern for deserialization that
        occurs locally via IPC as opposed to deserialization that occurs on a remote
        target like iMessage. The second is that this class violates one of the guarantees
        that the <code>NSData</code> class makes, that the <code>length</code> property
        will always return the length of the <code>bytes</code> property. This is
        because the length of the buffer returned by <code>[_NSDataFileBackedFuture
        bytes]</code> is the length of the loaded file, and has no relationship to
        the deserialized length returned by <code>[_NSDataFileBackedFuture length]</code>.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Putting
        this all together allowed for a file to be read remotely from an iPhone.</p></blockquote><p

        to address.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>In any case, the market decides for
        products like this. The HomePod just seems like it wasn&rsquo;t thought out

        price is way above what people want to pay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is

        (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20897368\">Hacker News</a>):</p>\n<blockquote
        cite=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/a-message-about-ios-security/\">\n<p>Last
        week, Google published a blog about vulnerabilities that Apple fixed for iOS
        users in February.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;A blog,&rdquo; rather than
        &ldquo;a blog post&rdquo;? I love how Apple is subtly trying to discredit
        Project Zero by implying that it&rsquo;s a mere blog. And let&rsquo;s be sure
        everyone knows it&rsquo;s affiliated with Google, the privacy bad guys, even
        though it&rsquo;s a responsible, technically focused group. Of course, the
        quote you&rsquo;re reading is not from a blog by Apple PR. It&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Apple
        Statement.&rdquo; From the Newsroom. Which has an <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/rss-feed.rss\">RSS
        feed</a>, like blogs do. (Though the feed isn&rsquo;t discoverable from the
        statement page.)</p>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/a-message-about-ios-security/\">\n<p>First,
        the sophisticated attack was narrowly focused, not a broad-based exploit of
        iPhones &ldquo;en masse&rdquo; as described.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/a-very-deep-dive-into-ios-exploit.html\">Project
        Zero</a> literally referred to &ldquo;a small collection of hacked websites&rdquo;
        that received &ldquo;receive thousands of visitors per week.&rdquo; And it
        does seem like a particular subpopulation was targeted &ldquo;en masse.&rdquo;
        The sites in question were on the public Internet; it wasn&rsquo;t links being
        sent to target particular individuals. Apple is blaming the messenger for
        things it didn&rsquo;t even say.</p>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/a-message-about-ios-security/\">\n<p>The
        attack affected fewer than a dozen websites that focus on content related
        to the Uighur community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh, I get it. Most people
        would consider &ldquo;fewer than a dozen&rdquo; to be &ldquo;a small collection.&rdquo;
        But in Apple-speak, there were &ldquo;a small number&rdquo; of <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2012/07/05/corrupt-app-store-binaries-crashing-on-launch/\">corrupt
        App Store binaries causing crashes</a>, and &ldquo;a small number&rdquo; of
        <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2018/10/16/the-2018-macbook-keyboards-have-the-same-old-problems/#the-2018-macbook-keyboards-have-the-same-old-problems-2019-03-27\">MacBook
        Pro users experiencing butterfly keyboard problems</a>, not to be confused
        with the &ldquo;very small number&rdquo; of iPhones that <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/iphone6s-unexpectedshutdown\">unexpectedly</a>
        <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/12/06/apples-support-gap/\">shut down</a>.
        So, yeah, I can see why Apple wants people to know that this &ldquo;small
        collection&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;millions.&rdquo; Although there
        are apparently <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Uighur\">10 million</a>
        Uigurs in China&#8230;</p>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/a-message-about-ios-security/\">\n<p>Google&rsquo;s
        post, issued six months after iOS patches were released[&#8230;]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s
        great that Project Zero reported this in a responsible way, because now we
        can downplay it as old news.</p>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/a-message-about-ios-security/\">\n<p>Second,
        all evidence indicates that these website attacks were only operational for
        a brief period, roughly two months, not &ldquo;two years&rdquo; as Google
        implies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how they know that there
        weren&rsquo;t other sites than the ones they considered. Why would someone
        go to the trouble of targeting iOS 10.0.1 separately from iOS 10.3&mdash;or
        even target iOS 10 at all&mdash;if the attack was only for two months in 2018
        (after iOS 12 was out)?</p>\n\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/a-message-about-ios-security/\">\n<p>We
        fixed the vulnerabilities in question in February &mdash; working extremely
        quickly to resolve the issue just 10 days after we learned about it. When
        Google approached us, we were already in the process of fixing the exploited
        bugs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Apparently, this is because they were tipped
        off by the FBI first, but mentioning that would make this seems more serious
        than Apple wants. This way they get to pretend that they&rsquo;re smarter
        than Google.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, an odd response from Apple. Maybe this is
        really smart PR before the big event next week. But, from my perspective,
        it is not a good look.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lorenzofb/status/1170025885904359424\">Lorenzo

        this affects a minority that is actively being suppressed and effectively
        annihilated by the Chinese government. Perhaps dismissing the gravity of the
        hacks is not the best approach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/_DanielSinclair/status/1170024164918484993\">Daniel

        I&rsquo;m still fascinated by the &ldquo;fewer than a dozen&rdquo; phrasing.
        Surely, Apple would want us to know if it were fewer than ten, i.e. single
        digits. So the number is likely ten or eleven, yet they didn&rsquo;t want
        to say the exact number. And I don&rsquo;t think the number of sites is actually
        that important. A single popular site would be worse than many small ones.
        The number that matters is how many people were affected, and it&rsquo;s likely
        not small. Yet this is the lead &ldquo;fact&rdquo; that Apple wanted to communicate.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s
        also worth noting that this response dropped on a Friday, and that it doesn&rsquo;t
        include a link to the post it&rsquo;s critiquing, or mention its title or
        author. So if you don&rsquo;t actually read it for yourself, you&rsquo;re
        left with the implication that it was some sort of dishonest corporate smear
        campaign.</p>\n\n<p>See also: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/06/apple-addresses-ios-vulnerabilities/\">MacRumors</a>,

        why did Apple respond to that Project Zero disclosure anyway? The researchers

        information in their statement. What was the point?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I
        think it&rsquo;s because some of the reporting sensationalized Project Zero&rsquo;s
        work and didn&rsquo;t make it clear that the patches were already in place.
        Apple chose to attack Google, rather than the media responsible for that coverage.</p>\n<p>That
        might also have been avoided if Apple had kept its own customers informed
        about its products, instead of leaving its competitor to disclose the biggest
        security incident in iOS history. Now, every time Apple touts how secure its
        stuff is, you have to wonder whether there are more incidents like this that
        they are hiding from you, which is a shame because I think they&rsquo;re doing
        a pretty good job with the actual security work.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1170064458003054594\">Alex

        between &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; and &ldquo;disgusting&rdquo;.</p><p>First
        off, disputing Google&rsquo;s correct use of &ldquo;indiscriminate&rdquo;

        out of hand is extremely risky.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Third, the pivot

        you take a vehicle loaned out by Zipcar&mdash;a rental service where drivers
        use RFID cards or a mobile app to open up the car&mdash;to an area without
        cell reception, there&rsquo;s a chance the car will not work. The doors won&rsquo;t
        open, and even if they do, the engine will not start. And because you will
        be in an area with no cell reception, it might be impossible for you to call
        for help.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Zipcars in general work just fine when
        they do not have cell service, he said, as they have some internal memory
        that lets them function even when out of touch with the company servers. Indeed,
        making sure that the cars work when out of reception is a &ldquo;mission-critical
        success factor&rdquo; for the company, he said. Still, cars without reception
        become vulnerable in a few scenarios: when members lose or do not have their
        physical Zipcard with them, when they exceed their reservation time or want
        to extend their Zipcar reservation, or when the vehicle battery dies. That
        last scenario was the one my family and I found ourselves in, though we did
        not know it at the time.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>He was amazed&mdash;and
        I was amazed&mdash;in part because Zipcar does not warn users that they need
        to take extra precautions in areas without reception, whether the bowels of
        parking garages or overlook points on mountainous roads.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I

        29 August 2019, Google&rsquo;s Project Zero security research team released
        the details of <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/a-very-deep-dive-into-ios-exploit.html\">a
        major series of attacks against iOS</a> using sophisticated, zero-day exploits
        on a scale unprecedented in the iOS world. (Wired has <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ios-attack-watering-hole-project-zero/\">a
        less technical summary of the Project Zero report</a>, which is aimed at security
        professionals.) This is the most significant iOS security incident we are
        aware of since the launch of the iPhone. And while it&rsquo;s extremely unlikely
        that any TidBITS readers had their devices compromised, the news remains a
        concerning development.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Infection was easy: if a
        user visited one of the hacked Web sites using an iOS device, that device
        would be infected with implanted malware without having to interact with the
        user in any way. That malware could monitor the infected device&rsquo;s GPS
        location data in real time, up to once per minute. It could also steal files
        on the device[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>First off, because Google
        reported all the exploits to Apple quickly, and Apple responded by patching
        them all in iOS within days, you&rsquo;re protected from these particular
        attacks as long as you&rsquo;re running an updated version of iOS. The implant
        malware could also be removed merely by restarting the iPhone.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a

        cite=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09032019a\">\n<p>As a reminder,
        Mac software distributed outside the Mac App Store must be notarized by Apple
        in order to run on macOS Catalina. To make this transition easier and to protect
        users on macOS Catalina who continue to use older versions of software, we&rsquo;ve
        adjusted the notarization prerequisites until January 2020.</p>\n<p>You can
        now notarize Mac software that:</p>\n<ul><li>Doesn&rsquo;t have the Hardened
        Runtime capability enabled.</li>\n<li>Has components not signed with your
        Developer ID.</li>\n<li>Doesn&rsquo;t include a secure timestamp with your
        code-signing signature.</li>\n<li>Was built with an older SDK.</li>\n<li>Includes
        the com.apple.security.get-task-allow entitlement with the value set to any
        variation of true.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This makes a lot of sense
        because the main benefit of notarization is the malware scan. It was never
        necessary to bundle that with all the other requirements.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rosyna/status/1168994427542679554\">Rosyna

        delay, while helpful, doesn&rsquo;t address the core issues.</p>\n<p>There
        is no easy way to tell if an app is notarized.  End-users can&rsquo;t tell
        which apps are or are not notarized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree that
        there remain problems, but I don&rsquo;t think this is something that end
        users need to be concerned with checking. Except for unusual ways of getting
        an app onto a Mac, and manually bypassing the launch check, the system is
        going to enforce that everything is notarized.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tombridge.com/2019/09/03/apple-updates-notarization-requirements/\">Tom

        Munki&rsquo;s LaunchDaemons or Jamf&rsquo;s framework, this doesn&rsquo;t

        say lost, I mean really lost. Entire folders were either gone or corrupted.
        Apple&rsquo;s mechanism to <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/PH27917?locale=en_US\">recover
        deleted files</a> was of no help. The customers with weird folder duplicates
        were the &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; ones.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>A few weeks later,
        Apple finally indicated that <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190704121813/https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios_ipados_release_notes/ios_ipados_13_beta_3_release_notes#3319531\">there
        were some issues with iCloud</a> and the beta release. In the same week, they
        released a public beta and sent out an email to customers <em>encouraging
        them</em> to try out iOS 13.</p>\n<p>We did our best to understand the situation
        and provide information to Apple, but it felt like we were tossing bug reports
        into a black hole. The most discouraging part was when we tried to open an
        incident with Apple Developer Technical Support (DTS). After writing up a
        detailed report, we were informed that they don&rsquo;t support beta releases!</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>If
        a device is using an Apple ID that&rsquo;s also being used on a non-beta device,
        then iCloud shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed. If you install an iOS beta on your
        iPad, it doesn&rsquo;t get to use any cloud services because it puts the data
        on your iPhone or Mac at risk.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>As it is now, Apple
        is effectively telling you that your storage device will be unreliable for
        a few months. It&rsquo;s like having a hard drive where the manufacturer tells
        you it won&rsquo;t work well for &#xBC; of the year. Would you purchase storage
        with a caveat that &ldquo;the drive mechanism may not work properly during
        the hot summer months&rdquo;?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Previously:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a

        iCloud API updates to OS releases, but I really wish they wouldn&rsquo;t.
        Apple&rsquo;s coders are smart enough to make things backwards compatible,

        years iOS/iPadOS release cycle was a mess. The first public beta was surprisingly

        I actually think having the ability to backup and restore all of your iCloud
        data is a more attainable first step that would mitigate a lot of fear from
        situations like this in the future. Essentially, Apple could prevent beta
        releases of iOS from touching iCloud data unless the service first confirms
        that the user has completed a download of an iCloud backup file. Then, if
        anything goes wrong, the user can at least restore from that point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a

        in this is that it makes it considerably easier for us to drop our long-suffering
        iCloud support in 4.0 and consign it to the curmudgeon-accommodating Pleco
        Legacy app.</p>\n<p>I literally have a support email in my inbox right now
        about somebody losing their iCloud-synced flashcards due to an iOS 13 beta
        bug; if Apple&rsquo;s willing to ship a public release with broken iCloud
        then it&rsquo;s clear it can no longer be relied upon.</p>\n</blockquote><p

        in the menu bar to open the menu to quit the app, which reviewers said is
        &ldquo;confusing to users&rdquo;. I think that&rsquo;s debatable. The second

        the current summer sale, Timeular costs $53 for the hardware and basic features,
        $9/month for advanced features, or $299 for &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; tracking

        the thousands of other Mac apps on the market on September 1, 1989 I can only
        think of four (Panorama, Word, Excel and Photoshop) that are still sold today.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>I
        imagined a new Fetch that had all the improvements that I&rsquo;d daydreamed
        about, and none of the old code that made it so hard to implement new features.</p>\n<p>This,
        of course, is one of the classic blunders in software development. It was
        exhilarating to be free of the shackles of our legacy code. But with a blank
        slate and no clear destination or deadline, we spent years without getting
        anywhere close to having a product that we could actually sell. Meanwhile
        Fetch 5 stagnated, and customers who needed more than Fetch 5 could offer
        moved on.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>In January, 2018 I finally accepted that
        I wasn&rsquo;t going to make Fetch 6 happen. Apple had made it clear that
        32-bit apps like Fetch 5.7 weren&rsquo;t long for this world, so it looked
        like the time had come to lay Fetch to rest for good. But I wasn&rsquo;t quite
        ready to say goodbye, and it occurred to me that there was a third option,
        something between finishing Fetch 6 and letting Fetch die: I could port Fetch
        5.7&rsquo;s Carbon user interface to Cocoa and make a 64-bit Fetch 5.8.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Previously:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a

        Development</a>:</p>\n<blockquote cite=\"https://blog.obdev.at/what-we-have-learned-from-a-vulnerability/\">\n<p>It
        all began with a security improvement by Apple in macOS High Sierra (10.13).
        Apple had revoked access to the folder <code>/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports</code>
        for non-admin users. The protection goes so far that even a root process spawned
        by <code>AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges()</code> cannot access the folder.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Every
        installer application which needs root permissions is now urged to install
        a system-wide daemon for this purpose. This system-wide daemon is usually
        left behind, because Apple provides no API for removing it.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>In
        an internal code review, another developer looked over the code and verified
        all assumptions. He did not find a proof for the assumption that XPC connections
        are authorized by the system. Since there was little information available,
        he made a test project and could exploit our privileged helper tool!</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>The
        helper (and the app using the helper) should check the identity of the peer
        before performing any operations. Even if an <code>AuthorizationExternalForm</code>
        is already used. The most secure way for such a check is the code signature.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Note
        that this example uses the private <code>NSXPCConnection.auditToken</code>
        property. If we want to avoid using a private property, we need to use the
        Unix process ID. But this is inherently insecure (see <a href=\"https://saelo.github.io/presentations/warcon18_dont_trust_the_pid.pdf\">Don&rsquo;t
        trust the PID!</a> by Samuel Gro&szlig;). We therefore decided to use <code>auditToken</code>
        anyway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, because Apple decided to protect the logs
        folder, and the documentation is not very good, the Little Snitch developers
        ended up introducing a privilege escalation vulnerability, and even now they
        can&rsquo;t make it fully secure without using private API. These are smart
        developers with a long history building a highly regarded security-focused
        product. Of course it sounds like a good idea to make the logs secure, but
        I think we can ask whether it was worth the cost in collateral security and
        engineering time. And why should it be so difficult and error-prone for an
        app to facilitate the customer sending in a diagnostic report?</p>\n\n<p>See

        a LaunchAgent, which I&rsquo;d guess is closer to what you&rsquo;d really

        this example, the ellipsis button is akin to choosing File &gt; Get Info on
        the Mac to open the Get Info window, which displays metadata about the selected
        file. Interestingly, Wallet only recently switched to using the ellipsis button;
        before that, it relied on a button that looked like the lowercase letter i.
        Perhaps the i was awkward when localizing the interface into other languages
        and script systems, but it is <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:grs:7001:PI_PF_001\">an
        ISO standard symbol</a>.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say you then switch to the Music
        app to play some tunes. While playing a song, you see yet another ellipsis
        button. You might assume that tapping it would display more information about
        the song, perhaps like what you can see in iTunes when you choose Edit &gt;
        Song Info. But no, the ellipsis button in the iOS Music app brings up a list
        of track-specific actions, like adding it to your library, adding it to a
        playlist, creating an Apple Music station based on it, and so on.</p><p>[&#8230;]</p><p>These
        interface confusions extend to the Files app in iOS 13 as well. Much like
        with Wallet, Apple replaced a perfectly understandable Edit link with an ellipsis
        button. [&#8230;] No, this time it offers commands for scanning documents,
        connecting to servers, and the options to edit locations, favorites, and tags.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Reminds
        me of how the Mac gear icon has been used for so many different purposes.</p><p

        the problem was fairly straightforward, using a technique I learned from the
        Cedar/Mesa compiler in the early &rsquo;80s. Rather than representing string
        constants in the compilers using strings, they are now represented using a
        data structure called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)\">Ropes</a>.
        Concatenating two ropes requires only a small constant amount of memory.</p>\n<p>Any
        compiler for a language that supports constant folding of string concatenation
        will run into this problem unless there is a similarly low-space representation
        of two concatenated strings. This is a technique that should be in the bag
        of tricks of any compiler writer.</p>\n</blockquote><p class=\"tags\"><a rel=\"tag\"

        This newer API makes it possible to index items that don&rsquo;t have a one-to-one
        correspondence with files on disk. However, though the Spotlight user interface
        integrates results from both the old file-based Spotlight and Core Spotlight,
        it seems that the APIs for apps to do their own global querying only work
        with the former. Mail has been shifting towards using Core Spotlight for several
        releases, but until now the actual files in <tt>~/Library/Mail</tt> were still
        searchable. The message files are still there in Catalina, and there&rsquo;s
        still a Spotlight importer plug-in that can read them, but you can&rsquo;t
        actually search them.</p>\n<p>And this extends to <a href=\"https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/121187\">system

        think the siloing of Core Spotlight is part of Apple&rsquo;s privacy effort
        or that it actually aligns with this. The privacy effort is focussed on user
        consent. Once consent is given the data should be readily available. This
        allows for application integration, automation, platform extension and avoids
        duplicated effort. To me it seems we are actually looking at an incomplete
        implementation. API to search Core Spotlight is missing. API to access mail
        messages is missing.</p><p>For example: once access to photos is granted,
        photos can be accessed via the file system, via scripting, via <code>PHPhotoLibrary</code>,
        and via <code>MLMediaLibrary</code> frameworks. All sorts of things become
        (resp. remain) possible. All hinges on user consent.</p><p>The current siloing
        and move to Core Spotlight has two problems:</p><ul><li>Much information is
        no longer available as siloing proceeds faster than API evolution. E.g. there
        is no API to access not notes or email messages. This limits integration and
        automation opportunities. In some cases, third-party developers can resort
        to duplicating effort. E.g. by direct access to IMAP servers</li><li>Where
        public API to silos exist (PHPhotoLibrary, Contacts, &#8230;) the API lack
        the unifying nature of Spotlight / <code>NSMetadataQuery</code>. A public
        API to Core Spotlight should solve that.</li></ul></blockquote><p class=\"tags\"><a

        You can no longer download older versions of macOS for testing. The <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-sierra/id1127487414?ls=1&amp;mt=12\">Mac
        App Store link</a> works, but as soon as you GET, this appears[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>All
        of Apple&rsquo;s support documents make the assumption that you can download[&#8230;]
        That is no longer true.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, we have customers on 10.12 who
        are having issues with Twitterrific, and we can&rsquo;t fix the problems without
        seeing them first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/aldrinjtauro/status/1166805715698311168\">Aldrin

        you have a Mac that shipped on anything before Catalina, you can boot holding
        CMD-Shift-R and it&rsquo;ll download the recovery partition for the OS it
        shipped on. Then you can install that on another drive and use it for downloads.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However,
        this doesn&rsquo;t help with getting intermediate releases. You should be
        downloading and saving copies of those as they become available. If you haven&rsquo;t
        already done so, you may be able to use this <a href=\"https://7labs.io/tips-tricks/macos-sierra-direct-download.html\">workaround</a>
        to download them manually.</p>\n\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the question of how
        to install them. I recently set up an old Mac to use with my ScanSnap, whose
        software will <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2018/12/10/scansnap-64-bit-software-update/\">no
        longer run</a> on macOS 10.15. When installing from the recovery partition,
        I got an error that the software couldn&rsquo;t be verified. And I kept getting
        errors like that when trying to install two separate versions of macOS from
        installers I had previously downloaded.</p>\n<p>How could all three installers
        be damaged? The answer is that <a href=\"http://osxdaily.com/2015/01/19/fix-os-x-install-errors-cant-be-verified-error-occurred-preparing-mac/\">they
        weren&rsquo;t</a>:</p>\n<blockquote cite=\"http://osxdaily.com/2015/01/19/fix-os-x-install-errors-cant-be-verified-error-occurred-preparing-mac/\"><p>Two
        unusual error messages that can occur during the attempted installation of
        OS X El Capitan or OS X Yosemite are the <em>&ldquo;This copy of the Install
        OS X El Capitan application can&rsquo;t be verified. It may have been corrupted
        or tampered with during downloading&rdquo;</em> error, or a <em>&ldquo;This
        copy of the Install OS X Yosemite application can&rsquo;t be verified. It
        may have been corrupted or tampered with during downloading&rdquo;</em> message,
        or a more vague <em>&ldquo;An error occurred while preparing the installation.
        Try running again&rdquo;</em> error message.  Sometimes these can be resolved
        by simply rebooting and trying to reinstall OS X again (or re-downloading
        the OS X installer if it was damaged), but if the error messages are persistent,
        then you may find that modifying the system date of the Mac can be the resolution.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It
        seems that the installer is signed with a certificate that has expired. When
        booted from the installer, you can open Terminal and use the <code>date</code>
        command to <a href=\"https://bensmann.no/changing-system-date-from-terminal-os-x-recovery\">set
        the clock</a> to the past, i.e. to when that version of macOS was current.
        After installing, be sure to set the clock to the correct date, or various
        other things won&rsquo;t work properly.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1166787262736191488\">Paul

        fact that Apple no longer supports old versions of OS X in the latest Xcode&rsquo;s

        the answer right now is <em>&ldquo;Not much.&rdquo;</em> As mentioned in the

        the surface, Amazon is a scene of constant warfare. A growing share of goods
        on the platform are sold by third parties, who compete viciously for limited
        real estate. Some hop onto fast-selling listings with counterfeit goods, or
        frame their competitors with fake reviews. One common tactic is to find a
        once popular, but now abandoned product and hijack its listing, using the
        page&rsquo;s old reviews to make whatever you&rsquo;re selling appear trustworthy.</p>\n<p>Amazon&rsquo;s
        marketplace is so chaotic that not even Amazon itself is safe from getting
        hijacked.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Take <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB00870ZHCQ\"

        HDMI cable</a>. Amazon removed it and other listings after being contacted
        by <em>The Verge</em>, but before it was taken down, it was being used to
        sell two completely different alarm clocks: a &ldquo;Warmhoming 2019 Updated
        Wooden Digital Alarm Clock with 7 Levels Adjustable Brightness, Display Time
        Date Week Temperature for Bedroom Office Home,&rdquo; and a white wake-up
        light clock, which was out of stock. Strangely, that clock was listed as a
        second variety, color &ldquo;Blackadaafgew,&rdquo; yet the listing&rsquo;s
        copy referred to binoculars that &ldquo;can help you see a clear face from
        more than 650 feet away.&rdquo; Many of the Amazon listings appear to undergo
        multiple hijackings. </p>\n</blockquote><p class=\"tags\"><a rel=\"tag\" href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/tag/amazon/\">Amazon</a>

        is a somewhat unusual vulnerability I reported in iMessage. It has a number
        of consequences, including information leakage and the ability to remotely
        read files on a device. This blog post discusses the ways that an attacker
        could use this bug. It is a good example of how the large number of classes
        available for <code>NSKeyedArchiver</code> deserialization can make a bug
        more versatile. It&rsquo;s also a good example of how minor functional bugs
        can make a vulnerability more useful.</p><p>Please note that this blog post
        assumes some familiarity with <code>NSKeyedArchiver</code> deserialization.
        If you haven&rsquo;t read our general <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-fully-remote-attack-surface-of.html\">post</a>
        on iMessage, I&rsquo;d recommend reading that first.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>There
        are two immediate problems with being able to deserialize this class in an
        untrusted context. One is that it has the potential to allow a process to
        access a file that it is not authorized to access, because the process doing
        the deserialization is the one that loads the file. When I reported this bug,
        I thought that this was more likely to be a concern for deserialization that
        occurs locally via IPC as opposed to deserialization that occurs on a remote
        target like iMessage. The second is that this class violates one of the guarantees
        that the <code>NSData</code> class makes, that the <code>length</code> property
        will always return the length of the <code>bytes</code> property. This is
        because the length of the buffer returned by <code>[_NSDataFileBackedFuture
        bytes]</code> is the length of the loaded file, and has no relationship to
        the deserialized length returned by <code>[_NSDataFileBackedFuture length]</code>.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Putting
        this all together allowed for a file to be read remotely from an iPhone.</p></blockquote><p

        media consumption is a high-usage scenario, this extra power usage has a negative
        impact on battery life. This change will prevent the caching of certain media
        content to disk for the purpose of improving device battery life for users.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a

        derision from Apple haters; this generated derision from Apple&rsquo;s best
        customers.</p>\n<p>The support document is, in fact, putting function over
        form. Apple wants to tell its customers that the card won&rsquo;t look brand
        new forever and advise them on the best way to store it. That&rsquo;s the
        function of the document. But through bad writing&mdash;how many people read
        this before it was published?&mdash;it looks like Apple made a fragile card
        and is advising you to store it in a way that will destroy it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a
