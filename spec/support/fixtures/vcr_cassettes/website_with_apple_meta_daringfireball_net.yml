        thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at DF. Kolide is a new Slack app
        that messages employees when their Mac, Windows, or Linux device is not compliant
        with security best-practices or policy.</p>\n\n<p>With this app, Kolide will
        notify users or groups when a device is out of compliance along with clear
        instructions about what is wrong, and step by step instructions to remediate
        the issue themselves. They can even confirm in real-time that they resolved
        the problem with an interactive button inside the Slack message!</p>\n\n<p>Unlike
        most endpoint security solutions, Kolide was designed with user privacy in
        mind. Your users will know what data is collected about their device, who
        can see that data, and can even view the full source code of the agent that
        is run on the device.</p>\n\n<p>Kolide is already used by hundreds of fast
        growing companies who want to level-up their device security without locking
        down their devices. <a href=\"https://kolide.com/?utm_source=df&amp;utm_medium=talkshow&amp;utm_campaign=launch\">Try

        focused, not a\nbroad-based exploit of iPhones “en masse” as described. The
        attack\naffected fewer than a dozen websites that focus on content related\nto
        the Uighur community. Regardless of the scale of the attack, we\ntake the
        safety and security of all users extremely seriously.</p>\n\n<p>Google’s post,
        issued six months after iOS patches were released,\ncreates the false impression
        of “mass exploitation” to “monitor\nthe private activities of entire populations
        in real time,”\nstoking fear among all iPhone users that their devices had
        been\ncompromised. This was never the case.</p>\n\n<p>Second, all evidence
        indicates that these website attacks were\nonly operational for a brief period,
        roughly two months, not “two\nyears” as Google implies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Reading
        between the lines here, what Apple is pushing back on is the fact that Google’s
        report on this attack against the <a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/uyghur-spelling-09062010161733.html\">Uyghur</a>

        Gurman and Debby Wu, reporting for Bloomberg<sup>*</sup>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n
        \ <p>Apple Inc. is developing in-screen fingerprint technology for as\nearly
        as its 2020 iPhones, according to people familiar with the\nplans. The technology
        is in testing both inside Apple and among\nthe company’s overseas suppliers,
        though the timeline for its\nrelease may slip to the 2021 iPhone refresh,
        said the people, who\nasked not to be identified discussing private work.
        […]</p>\n\n<p>The upcoming fingerprint reader would be embedded in the screen,\nletting
        a user scan their fingerprint on a large portion of the\ndisplay, and it would
        work in tandem with the existing Face ID\nsystem, the people familiar with
        Apple’s plans said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If true, I would guess this would
        be an optional way to increase security by requiring both Face ID <em>and</em>
        Touch ID authentication.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple is also working on
        its first low-cost iPhone since the\niPhone SE. That could come out as early
        as the first half of 2020,\nthe people said. The device would look similar
        to the iPhone 8 and\ninclude a 4.7-inch screen. The iPhone 8 currently sells
        for $599,\nwhile Apple sold the iPhone SE for $399 when that device launched\nin
        2016. The new low-cost phone is expected to have Touch ID built\ninto the
        home button, not the screen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The SE debuted about
        6 months after the iPhone 6S, with the same A9 chipset. If Apple follows the
        same playbook, this new iPhone would have the A13 chip we expect to see in
        next week’s new iPhones — the iPhone 8 has an A11 that will soon be two years
        old. Makes a lot of sense — none of the X-class phones are going to drop to
        $400 in 2020, but it would be good for Apple and for users if there were a
        $400 iPhone with A13 specs. The only downside of this report is for people
        holding onto hope that Apple will make a new SE-sized phone with a 4-inch
        display. I would expect this rumored phone to look as much like an iPhone
        8 as the SE looks like an iPhone 5S.</p>\n\n<p><small>* Bloomberg, of course,
        is the publication that published “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/bloomberg_the_big_hack\">The
        Big Hack</a>” last October — a sensational story alleging that data centers
        of Apple, Amazon, and dozens of other companies were compromised by China’s
        intelligence services. The story presented no confirmable evidence at all,
        was <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/10/what-businessweek-got-wrong-about-apple/\">vehemently
        denied</a> by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/setting-the-record-straight-on-bloomberg-businessweeks-erroneous-article/\">all
        companies</a> involved, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/10/22/your-move-bloomberg/?utm_term=.30e1ef835198\">has
        not been confirmed by a single other publication</a> (despite much effort
        to do so), and has been <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/10/09/big-hack-doubts\">largely
        discredited by one of Bloomberg’s own sources</a>. By all appearances “The
        Big Hack” was complete bullshit. Yet Bloomberg has issued no correction or
        retraction, and seemingly hopes we’ll all just forget about it. I say we do
        not just forget about it. Bloomberg’s institutional credibility is severely
        damaged, and everything they publish should be treated with skepticism until
        they retract the story or provide evidence that it was true.</small></p>\n\n</dd>\n\n\n<dt>\n<a

        launching a deluge of tests — it just\nannounced that a few sought-after features
        in the pipeline. Most\nnotably, it’s developing a long-overdue search for
        direct\nmessages. Although there aren’t many specifics at this point, it’s\nreasonable
        to say this will spare you from digging through a\nconversation to find a
        crucial message from days ago. The social\nnetwork added that it’s “re-energizing”
        its work on DMs, so this\nis really just the highlight of a larger strategy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Weeks-old
        news but I didn’t see it until just now. The lack of any search at all for
        Twitter DMs makes iMessage search seem useful.</p>\n\n<p>My experiment with
        leaving my DMs open to everyone on Twitter has been successful, by the way — very
        little spam, very high signal-to-noise from folks whom I don’t follow (who,

        Fleishman, writing at Macworld, “How to Open Items in the Enclosing Folder
        Directly From a Spotlight Search in macOS”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One
        might think after many years of Spotlight search being in\nmacOS that there
        would be no new tricks. But a colleague on\nTwitter asked a reasonable question
        and many people chimed in with\nthe same query: When viewing a list of results
        in a Spotlight\nsearch in the Finder, how do you jump to see the item in the\ncontext
        of its enclosing folder rather than just opening the file?</p>\n\n<p>The answer
        is simple: hold down Command and press the Return key\nor press Command-R.
        You can also hold down Command and\ndouble-click the item in the results list.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Using
        the Command key as a modifier to reveal items in the Finder while clicking
        has a long and consistent history on the Mac. You can also Command-click items
        in the Dock to reveal them rather than open them. (If you Command-Option-click
        a folder in the Dock it will open that folder, rather than reveal that folder
        in its parent folder.) Also useful: you can click on a folder in the Dock
        (Downloads is one I use this with frequently) and then Command-click on one
        of the items in the menu listing the folder’s contents. And in document-based
        apps, you can Command-click on the document’s proxy icon in the window’s title
        bar and you’ll get a pop-up menu showing the folder hierarchy of the document’s
        location in the file system. Select any of those folders and you’ll go to
        that folder in the Finder.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> From System
        7 in 1991 through MacOS 10.13 High Sierra, ⌘R was also the shortcut for “Show
        Original” in the Finder. Select an alias (or symlink), hit ⌘R, and you’d see
        what the alias/symlink was pointing to. In MacOS 10.14 Mojave last year, some
        idiot at Apple changed the shortcut for “Make Alias” from ⌘L to ⌤⌘A and the
        shortcut for “Show Original” to ⌤⌥⌘A. Someone told me why this idiot made
        this change, but damned if I can remember or figure it out, because it doesn’t
        seem like the Finder in Mojave or Catalina uses ⌘R or ⌘L for anything else.
        Someone just decided to change 30-year-old shortcuts with no regard for muscle
        memory or consistency with other places where ⌘R reveals something in the
        Finder. (<a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236\">Apple still
        has support documents with the old shortcuts</a>.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update
        to Sidenote:</strong> Thanks to a few readers for reminding me — starting
        with 10.14 Mojave, ⌘R and ⌘L are now used for rotating images right and left.
        I couldn’t find the shortcuts because (a) they only work when an image file
        is selected, and (b) they don’t have commands in the Finder’s menu bar, another
        bit of UI lunacy.</p>\n\n<p>And to top this all off — truly, this is genuinely
        hard to believe — these ⌘R and ⌘L shortcuts not only break 27-year-old Finder
        shortcuts, but they aren’t even consistent with Photos, <a href=\"/misc/2019/09/photos-rotate-shortcuts.png\">which
        uses ⌘R for “Rotate Counterclockwise” and ⌥⌘R for “Rotate Clockwise”</a>.
        So in Photos the R maps to <em>R</em>otate not <em>R</em>ight, and the direction
        for an image rotated using ⌘R is <em>left</em>/counterclockwise. I don’t use
        the word lightly, but whoever pushed this change through for the Finder is
        an idiot.</p>\n\n<p><strong>One More Update:</strong> There <em>is</em> some
        consistency to using ⌘L and ⌘R as shortcuts for “Rotate Left” and “Rotate
        Right” — those are the same command names and shortcuts that Preview uses.
        But there’s no reason Preview doesn’t use the same command names and shortcuts
        as Photos, and Photos’s use of “Clockwise” and “Counterclockwise” is, in my
        opinion, more clear than “Right” and “Left”. And, lastly, if you miss the
        longstanding use of ⌘L and ⌘R in the Finder for “Make Alias” and “Show Original”,
        <a href=\"/misc/2019/09/fixing-finder-alias-shortcuts.png\">you can easily
        restore them manually in the Keyboards pane in System Preferences</a> — one
        of the great features of MacOS. You can also make custom shortcuts for the
        Finder’s “Rotate Left” and “Rotate Right” commands, even though they’re both
        hidden menu items.</p>\n\n<p><strong>OK, OK, I Swear This One Really Is the

        at least to System 7 in 1991, and possibly earlier — is that you can Command-click
        on any window in the background and drag it around <em>without bringing the

        title=\"Permanent link to ‘Going Pro’\">Going Pro</a></h1>\n<h6 class=\"dateline\">Wednesday,
        \ 4 September 2019</h6>\n\n<p>Back on August 17, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1162766772572971008\">I
        tweeted this prediction on the naming scheme for this year’s lineup of new
        iPhones</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’ve been pushing for iPhones “Pro”
        at least since the iPhone X.\nMakes sense to me:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone XR
        → iPhone 11</li>\n<li>iPhone XS → iPhone 11 Pro</li>\n<li>iPhone XS Max →
        iPhone 11 Pro Max</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My record in this particular
        regard is abysmal. As noted in my tweet, I’ve been calling for Apple to go
        “Pro” with its high-end iPhones at least since the iPhone X was just a rumor.
        And even when the string “iPhone X” was revealed in a last-minute software
        leak the weekend before it was actually revealed, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/x_man\">I
        confidently predicted</a> that it would be pronounced <em>iPhone Ex</em>,
        not <em>iPhone Ten</em>. Anyone who’s been betting based on my iPhone naming
        predictions is deep in the hole at this point.</p>\n\n<p>But — lo! — like
        a stopped clock being right twice a day, I might actually have called it this
        time. Mark Gurman — who correctly predicted the “iPhone X as ten” name in
        2017 — <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-22/iphone-11-new-ipad-pro-16-inch-macbook-pro-airpods-3-features\">described
        this year’s lineup on August 22 thus</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple
        is planning to launch three new iPhones, as it has done each\nyear since 2017:
        “Pro” iPhone models to succeed the iPhone XS and\niPhone XS Max as well as
        a successor to the iPhone XR.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s why I think
        an “11 / 11 Pro / 11 Pro Max” naming scheme makes perfect sense. First, I
        hate Roman numerals with an irrational passion, so I’m not even going to get
        into the idea that Apple might have even considered “iPhone XI”. Just no.</p>\n\n<p>Second,
        the most common suggestion in response to my “iPhone 11 / 11 Pro / 11 Pro
        Max” tweet was that Apple should just drop the numbers completely, and go
        with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone (new XR)</li>\n<li>iPhone Pro (new XS)</li>\n<li>iPhone
        Pro Max (new XS Max)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the abstract, such a naming strategy
        <em>would</em> be better. It would match Apple’s other product lineups — MacBooks
        and iPads — where higher priced models are Pro and lower priced ones are not.
        MacBook Pros and iPad Pros don’t get numbered sequentially by product generation.
        When new ones come out, they’re just called “MacBook Pro” and “iPad Pro” and
        Apple uses model years (e.g. “late 2019”) to specify exact models in support
        documentation — but never in advertising or product packaging.</p>\n\n<p>Nice
        and clean. And it would do away with the ungainliness of ever-incrementing
        integers in product names. Are we really going to have an “iPhone 19” at some
        point? I get that.</p>\n\n<p>But we don’t live in the abstract. In the real
        world, there is a huge difference between how Apple maintains the iPhone lineup
        compared to MacBooks and iPads. When new MacBooks and iPads debut, they almost
        always replace the preceding models. When you go into a store to buy an iPad
        Pro, the only models available are the latest and greatest.</p>\n\n<p>The
        iPhone lineup works very differently. Older models hang around — in production
        — for <em>years</em>. Apple just slots them into lower price points as they
        get older. And one thing many people don’t know is that the lineup of iPhones
        Apple itself sells online and in its own retail stores is not the full lineup
        of iPhones they continue to manufacture and sell through other channel partners.
        The lineup Apple promotes makes it look, for example, like the iPhone X went
        out of production a year ago after the iPhone XS was introduced. But carriers
        around the world still sell it, as do big box retailers (dying breed that
        they are) <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/iphone/iphone-x/pcmcat1505326434742.c?id=pcmcat1505326434742\">like
        Best Buy</a>. You can still buy brand-new iPhone 6S models in some countries.</p>\n\n<p>I
        didn’t really know the extent of this myself until recently. Two years ago
        I was behind the idea that the phone we now know as the “iPhone X” should
        have been the first “iPhone Pro”. Then last year’s XS models would have been
        the <em>new</em> “iPhones Pro”, and this year’s models the <em>new</em> “iPhones
        Pro” again. But given that Apple wants to keep making and selling the older
        models, this non-numbered naming scheme would be confusing. It wouldn’t work
        unless Apple were to drop its decade-long strategy of keeping years-old iPhones
        in production at lower price points, and I don’t see any reason why Apple
        would drop that strategy.</p>\n\n<p>Apple Watch is similar to the iPhone in
        this way. They’re using the “Series #” naming scheme so that they can keep
        older models in the lineup at lower prices. I’m not saying Apple has to keep
        using numbers for new iPhones, but I do think their fundamental strategy of
        using years-old models to fill lower price points in the lineup necessitates
        <em>unique names</em> for each model year. Especially so given how the fundamental
        industrial design doesn’t change for years at a time. The iPhone XS didn’t
        look any different from the iPhone X externally.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I like
        about an “11 / 11 Pro / 11 Pro Max” naming scheme is that by calling the new
        XR the just plain “iPhone 11”, it would implicitly establish the new XR model
        as the <em>default</em> iPhone, the iPhone most people should buy. It should
        be branded as the default new iPhone because it should be considered the default
        new iPhone. Most people don’t notice or care about the difference between
        the XR’s @2x LCD display and the XS’s @3x OLED display. They don’t care about
        the slightly bigger bezels surrounding the XR display (if only because they
        immediately put their new iPhone in a protective case). They don’t care about
        the fact that the higher-end iPhones have more cameras on the back, because
        they take all of their photos using the default 1x camera lens.<sup id=\"fnr1-2019-09-04\"><a
        href=\"#fn1-2019-09-04\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>And the fact that the iPhone
        XR gets the longest battery life of any iPhone — something I would expect
        the XR’s successor to maintain, because it’s mainly attributable to its use
        of an LCD rather than OLED display — is a factor that typical iPhone owners
        <em>do</em> appreciate. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/the_iphone_xr\">I
        declared last year’s iPhone XR the best iPhone for most people</a>, and I
        expect this year’s XR successor to be the same. Fun colors, lower price, longer
        battery life — that’s all you need to say. Thus, calling it the just plain
        “iPhone 11” would be spot-on branding-wise.</p>\n\n<p>Some object to the notion
        that any iPhone can be “Pro” in the sense of “professional”. That’s nonsense.
        For one thing, plenty of people buy MacBook Pros and iPad Pros for non-professional
        use. They just want them because they’re better and/or bigger. If you want
        a 15-inch MacBook or 13-inch iPad, you’re getting a Pro model because it’s
        your only choice. “Pro”, in Apple product marketing parlance, does mean <em>professional</em>
        sometimes (e.g. Mac Pro and iMac Pro). But sometimes it just means <em>premium</em>.
        Second, iPhones are absolutely used professionally, and the better camera
        systems alone can justify the nomenclature. For many people, their phone is
        their most-used and most-important work device.</p>\n\n<p>A better argument
        is that there’s no reason to call the bigger model “Max”. Just call them both
        “iPhone 11 Pro” — like Apple does with MacBook and iPad Pros — and people
        will buy the size they prefer without confusion. “Pro Max” sounds a bit like
        a vitamin supplement for weightlifters, frankly. (<strong>Update:</strong>
        “Pro Max” actually <em>is</em> <a href=\"https://www.promaxnutrition.com/\">the
        name of a nutrition supplement</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>I will note, though, that in
        advertising, Apple advertised both sizes of iPhone XS under the “iPhone XS”
        brand umbrella last year. <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iphone+xs+billboards&amp;t=ipad&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images\">This
        print campaign</a>, for example, never mentioned the word “Max”. <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QMWcmzwvw9U\">This
        TV spot did</a>, but only for a split second, after the slogan “It’s not just
        one amazing new iPhone. It’s two.”</p>\n\n<p>If they really do go with “iPhone
        11 Pro Max” for the 6.5-inch model this year, I would expect them to do the
        same, and mostly advertise both 11 Pro models under the name “iPhone 11 Pro”,
        and simply <em>show</em> that it comes in two sizes.</p>\n\n<h2>Postscript:
        Why I Think Last Year’s iPhone XR Will Fill the Mid-Range Price Slot</h2>\n\n<p>So
        assuming the rumors are correct and we get “iPhone 11 / 11 Pro / 11 Pro Max”
        new models next week, which of last year’s models will Apple keep around in
        its own product lineup?</p>\n\n<p>I think it’s pretty simple. The XS and XS
        Max go away (or, as explained above, remain available only from non-Apple
        retailers, like carriers and Best Buy) and the iPhone XR stays in the official
        lineup at a lower price point. Aluminum, not stainless steel. LCD display,
        not OLED. Just one camera on the back. All of those factors make it obvious
        just by looking at it that the iPhone XR would and should be a lower-priced
        phone than all of the new phones for 2019.&nbsp;<a class=\"permalink\" title=\"Permanent

        class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2019-09-04\">\n<p><em>I</em>
        use the 2x “telephoto” lens on my XS, and perhaps you do too. I particularly
        enjoy the superior Portrait Mode experience it affords. (Portrait Mode on
        the X and XS always and only uses the 2x lens for the photo — you can neither
        zoom in nor out in Portrait Mode.) And I look forward to using the much-rumored
        wider-angled third lens on the new Pro iPhones. But I’m a photography enthusiast,
        and the vast majority of iPhone owners are not. Every iPhone owner actually
        benefits from better optics when they do “zoom in” for a photo using an iPhone
        with a 2x lens, but I don’t think an extra camera lens feels worth a $250
        premium to most of them.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2019-09-04\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"

        Used iPhone Hacks to Target Uyghur Muslims’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/09/02/whittaker-china-ios\">&#9733;</a>\n</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>Zack
        Whittaker, reporting for TechCrunch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A number of
        malicious websites used to hack into iPhones over a\ntwo-year period were
        targeting Uyghur Muslims, TechCrunch has\nlearned.</p>\n\n<p>Sources familiar
        with the matter said the websites were part of a\nstate-backed attack — likely
        China — designed to target the\nUyghur community in the country’s Xinjiang
        state.</p>\n\n<p>It’s part of the latest effort by the Chinese government
        to crack\ndown on the minority Muslim community in recent history. In the\npast
        year, Beijing has detained more than a million Uyghurs in\ninternment camps,
        according to a United Nations human rights\ncommittee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Google’s
        Project Zero team discovered these exploits early this year, and Apple closed
        them shortly thereafter. This week, <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/a-very-deep-dive-into-ios-exploit.html\">the
        Project Zero team published their findings</a>, and it’s really extraordinary
        work. What makes this case so unusual is that these sort of exploits are worth
        millions of dollars, and they are typically used very selectively to target
        individuals. <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/a-very-deep-dive-into-ios-exploit.html\">What
        the Project Zero team discovered was different</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n
        \ <p>Earlier this year Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered\na
        small collection of hacked websites. The hacked sites were being\nused in
        indiscriminate watering hole attacks against their\nvisitors, using iPhone
        0-day.</p>\n\n<p>There was no target discrimination; simply visiting the hacked\nsite
        was enough for the exploit server to attack your device, and\nif it was successful,
        install a monitoring implant. We estimate\nthat these sites receive thousands
        of visitors per week.</p>\n\n<p>TAG was able to collect five separate, complete
        and unique iPhone\nexploit chains, covering almost every version from iOS
        10 through\nto the latest version of iOS 12. This indicated a group making
        a\nsustained effort to hack the users of iPhones in certain\ncommunities over
        a period of at least two years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What Project Zero
        did not reveal is where these infected websites were located, or what group(s)
        they were targeting. Now, we apparently know: it was the Chinese government
        targeting Uyghur Muslims.</p>\n\n</dd>\n\n\n<dt>\n<a href=\"https://tidbits.com/2019/08/30/less-is-more-apples-inconsistent-ellipses-icons-inspire-user-confusion/\">Apple’s

        analysis by Josh Centers at TidBITS on Apple’s increasing use of “•••” ellipsis
        buttons to show “more” in iOS:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The broader issue
        here in terms of usability isn’t the\nphilosophical issue of “what is more,”
        but the practical issue of\nwhat “More” means to the user. As you saw in the
        above examples,\ntapping an ellipsis button can activate a varying degree
        of user\ninterface elements. Unlike, say, the Share icon, which\nconsistently
        presents an activity view that contains\nsharing-related options, the behavior
        of ellipsis buttons isn’t\npredictable or consistent, which leads to user
        confusion. It\nconfuses me, and I’ve spent years documenting iOS!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n</dd>\n\n\n</dl>\n\n<h2

        sounds like a pain in the ass. How can you choose the right quarter-size increment
        ordering over the internet? Easy: Atoms sends you three pairs of shoes in
        quarter-size increments based on your normal shoe size. You pick the left
        and right shoe that feels best — a size 9 for your left foot and a 9.25 for
        your right, for example — and return the rest for free.</p>\n\n<p>I’m wearing
        a pair of Atoms as I type this — size 12 on my right foot, 12.5 on the left.
        I got the black and white, but they also have all-black and all-white. They’re
        very comfortable and still look near-new after months of wear. They’re simply

        the basic user who checks a few feeds once a day, NNW provides\na familiar

        Newsroom</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a result of our review, we realize
        we haven’t been fully living\nup to our high ideals, and for that we apologize.
        As we previously\nannounced, we halted the Siri grading program. We plan to
        resume\nlater this fall when software updates are released to our users —\nbut
        only after making the following changes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>First, by default,
        we will no longer retain audio recordings of\nSiri interactions. We will continue
        to use computer-generated\ntranscripts to help Siri improve.</p></li>\n<li><p>Second,
        users will be able to opt in to help Siri improve by\nlearning from the audio
        samples of their requests. We hope that\nmany people will choose to help Siri
        get better, knowing that\nApple respects their data and has strong privacy
        controls in\nplace. Those who choose to participate will be able to opt out\nat
        any time.</p></li>\n<li><p>Third, when customers opt in, only Apple employees
        will be\nallowed to listen to audio samples of the Siri interactions. Our\nteam
        will work to delete any recording which is determined to be\nan inadvertent
        trigger of Siri.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is all good. Opt-in
        only, with an easy way to opt back out. Inadvertent recordings will be deleted
        as soon as they’re identified. This bit, too, is interesting:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n
        \ <p>Siri uses a random identifier — a long string of letters and\nnumbers
        associated with a single device — to keep track of data\nwhile it’s being
        processed, rather than tying it to your identity\nthrough your Apple ID or
        phone number — a process that we believe\nis unique among the digital assistants
        in use today. For further\nprotection, after six months, the device’s data
        is disassociated\nfrom the random identifier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a
        href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20751270/apple-stops-contractors-siri-voice-recordings-privacy-opt-out\">The
        Verge had previously reported the following</a>, which made it sound like
        the recordings were tied to Apple IDs for the first six months:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n
        \ <p>Currently the company says it keeps recordings for six months\nbefore
        removing identifying information from a copy that it could\nkeep for two years
        or more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Verge wasn’t <em>wrong</em> there, but
        it’s an important clarification that the “identifying information” was a random
        per-device identifier that was designed not to be able to be tied back to
        an Apple ID or phone number.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210558\">Apple
        also has a “Siri Privacy and Grading” FAQ</a>, written in very clear language.
        Basically, Apple is admitting they fucked up on this grading thing, they’re
        owning up to it, and are committed to doing everything they should have been
        doing all along to protect users’ privacy <em>and</em> make everything as
        clear as possible to users.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2019/08/siri_privacy_trust\">My
        take on this saga</a> was severely critical, but I am convinced this was a
        mistake — really, a series of mistakes — on Apple’s part, not an indication
        that the company’s privacy stance is hypocritical or merely bullshit marketing
        hype. It is therefore not surprising, but satisfying nonetheless, to see Apple
        address it head-on like this. &nbsp;<a class=\"permalink\" title=\"Permanent

        the best “x” is “140 characters”. This statement is meant to de-value the
        technologies developed in the last few decades. Instead of building grand
        things, we build trivialities. The irony is that x is often wildly popular
        and ubiquitous. x also generates a lot of profits and is likely to change
        behavior. Indeed, the flying car alternatives are almost always better ideas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n</dd>\n\n\n<dt>\n<a

        anti-tracking measures with the\nsame seriousness as exploitation of security
        vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p>If a party attempts to circumvent our tracking
        prevention methods,\nwe may add additional restrictions without prior notice.
        These\nrestrictions may apply universally; to algorithmically classified\ntargets;
        or to specific parties engaging in circumvention.</p>\n\n<p><strong>No Exceptions</strong></p>\n\n<p>We
        do not grant exceptions to our tracking prevention technologies\nto specific
        parties. Some parties might have valid uses for\ntechniques that are also
        used for tracking. But WebKit often has\nno technical means to distinguish
        valid uses from tracking, and\ndoesn’t know what the parties involved will
        do with the collected\ndata, either now or in the future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unintended
        Impact</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are practices on the web that we do not intend
        to disrupt,\nbut which may be inadvertently affected because they rely on\ntechniques
        that can also be used for tracking. We consider this to\nbe unintended impact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Equating
        tracking with malware and security exploits is a major policy change, and
        absolutely correct. Notably, they are not respecting commercial interests
        <em>at all</em>. The user’s privacy comes first, and if there is commercial
        collateral damage from that, fuck it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>WebKit will
        do its best to <em>prevent</em> all covert tracking, and all\ncross-site tracking
        (even when it’s not covert). These goals apply\nto all types of tracking listed
        above, as well as tracking\ntechniques currently unknown to us.</p>\n\n<p>If
        a particular tracking technique cannot be completely prevented\nwithout undue
        user harm, WebKit will <em>limit the capability</em> of\nusing the technique.
        For example, limiting the time window for\ntracking or reducing the available
        bits of entropy — unique data\npoints that may be used to identify a user
        or a user’s behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hopefully, this will help close
        <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2019/07/superhuman_and_email_privacy\">the
        email tracking-pixel loophole as well</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The ball is now in Chrome’s
        court to follow suit. I think Google could aggressively close these same privacy-invasive
        loopholes without losing their ability to serve targeted ads — they’d simply
        be limited to serving targeted ads to users who sign into Chrome with their

        class=\"dateline\">Friday, 16 August 2019</h6>\n\n<p>Three weeks ago, writing
        for The Guardian, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings\">Alex
        Hern reported</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple contractors regularly hear
        confidential medical information,\ndrug deals, and recordings of couples having
        sex, as part of their\njob providing quality control, or “grading”, the company’s
        Siri\nvoice assistant, the Guardian has learned.</p>\n\n<p>Although Apple
        does not explicitly disclose it in its\nconsumer-facing privacy documentation,
        a small proportion of Siri\nrecordings are passed on to contractors working
        for the company\naround the world. They are tasked with grading the responses
        on a\nvariety of factors, including whether the activation of the voice\nassistant
        was deliberate or accidental, whether the query was\nsomething Siri could
        be expected to help with and whether Siri’s\nresponse was appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>Apple
        says the data “is used to help Siri and dictation …\nunderstand you better
        and recognise what you say”.</p>\n\n<p>But the company does not explicitly
        state that that work is\nundertaken by humans who listen to the pseudonymised
        recordings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I pooh-poohed this story at first, mostly
        on the grounds that I thought we knew about this, and that the recordings
        were only saved from users who had consented to it. I was mistaken. This is
        a privacy fiasco, and a betrayal of Siri users’ trust.</p>\n\n<p>A week later,
        Apple issued statements to TechCrunch and The Verge stating that it was suspending
        this “grading” program. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/apple-suspends-siri-response-grading-in-response-to-privacy-concerns/\">From
        Matthew Panzarino’s report at TechCrunch</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple
        says it will review the process that it uses, called\ngrading, to determine
        whether Siri is hearing queries correctly,\nor being invoked by mistake.</p>\n\n<p>In
        addition, it will be issuing a software update in the future\nthat will let
        Siri users choose whether they participate in the\ngrading process or not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My
        reading of this is that until last week, if you used Siri in any way, your
        recordings might be used in this “grading” process. If I graded Apple on the
        privacy and trust implications of this, I’d give them an F. I don’t think
        it’s debatable whether users of <em>any</em> voice assistant should have their
        recordings listened to or even reviewed (in text form) by human employees
        without their express consent. But especially users of Siri, given Apple’s
        prominent position as a privacy focused company. <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/05/apple-privacy-billboard-vegas-ces/\">Apple
        literally advertises on the basis of its user-focused privacy policies</a> — but
        apparently the billboards should have read “What happens on your iPhone stays
        on your iPhone, except for some of your Siri recordings, which we listen to.”</p>\n\n<p><a
        href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20751270/apple-stops-contractors-siri-voice-recordings-privacy-opt-out\">From
        Sam Byford’s report for The Verge</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple did
        not comment on whether, in addition to pausing the\nprogram where contractors
        listen to Siri voice recordings, it\nwould also stop actually saving those
        recordings on its servers.\nCurrently the company says it keeps recordings
        for six months\nbefore removing identifying information from a copy that it
        could\nkeep for two years or more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Until the opt-in
        process is crystal clear, Apple should delete all existing recordings and
        confirm that it is no longer saving them. I don’t even know where to start
        with the fact that until this story broke, they were keeping copies <em>with
        identifying information</em> for six months. This defies everyone’s expectations
        of privacy for a voice assistant.</p>\n\n<p>We should expect Apple to lead
        the industry on this front, but in fact, they’re far behind. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=kinw_myk_alxa_faq_us?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=201602230&amp;pop-up=1\">Amazon
        has a FAQ</a> written in plain language that explains how Alexa works, and
        how to view your voice recordings from Alexa-powered devices. You can review
        them in the Alexa app in Settings: Alexa Privacy (a pretty obvious location)
        or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings\">on the web</a>.
        That settings page also has an option: “Use Voice Recordings to Improve Amazon
        Services and to Develop New Features”. I think Amazon should make clear that
        with this turned on, some of your recordings may be listened to by Amazon
        employees, but it’s not too hard to surmise that’s what’s going on.</p>\n\n<p>Apple
        offers no such setting, and offers absolutely no way to know which, if any,
        of our Siri recordings have been saved for review by employees. This is something
        we should have explicit, precise control over, but instead it’s a completely
        black box we have no control over or insight into whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>From
        a privacy perspective, there are two fundamental types of Siri interactions:
        purposeful and accidental. Purposeful interactions are when you press the
        side button or say “Hey Siri” with the intention of invoking Siri. Accidental
        interactions occur when the button is pressed too long accidentally, or when
        a device incorrectly hears “Hey Siri” even though you said no such thing.
        All recorded Siri interactions should be treated by Apple with extraordinary
        care, but accidental invocations, when identified, should be deleted immediately
        unless the user has expressly agreed to allow it — <em>each and every time</em>.
        Having Apple contractors listen to random conversations or audio is the nightmare
        scenario for an always-listening voice assistant.</p>\n\n<p>Compare and contrast
        with iOS’s transcript feature for voicemail. At the bottom of each transcription,
        iOS asks whether the transcription was “useful” or “not useful”. Tap on either
        of those and you get a very explicit prompt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Help
        Improve Transcriptions?</p>\n\n<p>Would you like to submit this voicemail
        to Apple to improve\ntranscription accuracy?</p>\n\n<p>Recordings will only
        be used to improve the quality of speech\nrecognition in Apple products.</p>\n\n<p>Do
        not submit recordings if you believe the speaker would be\nuncomfortable with
        you submitting the content to Apple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The two buttons
        at the bottom of the prompt: Cancel and Submit. You must address this same
        prompt every single time you flag a transcription as useful or not useful.
        Every time. That’s how you do it.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to being correctly
        respectful of privacy, the voicemail transcription feature also puts the user
        in control. So when a voicemail is transcribed poorly, you can flag it and
        submit it to Apple. That would be a great feature for Siri — when an interaction
        goes poorly, and we know the interaction was innocuous in terms of revealing
        anything private, we should be able to flag it and submit it to Apple. I firmly
        believe that Siri has gotten far more useful and far more accurate in the
        last few years, but clearly it’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielpunkass/status/1073723442179031041\">still
        very far from perfect</a>. I’d be happy to help Apple by submitting failed
        interactions <em>on a per-interaction basis</em>. Apple needs to stop pretending
        Siri is perfect.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll give the final word to Steve Jobs, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/video/d8-steve-jobs-onstage-full-length-video/70F7CC1D-FFBF-4BE0-BFF1-08C300E31E11.html\">speaking
        about privacy back in 2010 at Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg’s D8 conference</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n
        \ <p>“Privacy means people know what they’re signing up for, in plain\nEnglish
        and repeatedly. I believe people are smart and some people\nwant to share
        more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them\nevery time. Make them
        tell you to stop asking them if they get\ntired of your asking them. Let them
        know precisely what you’re\ngoing to do with their data.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I
        can’t say it any better than that.&nbsp;<a class=\"permalink\" title=\"Permanent
